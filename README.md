# citi-bike-analytics

So going to look at monthly covid usage of citi bike, to the 3 year running average prior to the pandemic, as new york was empty, 
I bet there was a dramatic drop in usage.

Also going to look at seasonality of citi bike, 
so need either 4 quarters or 2 half year benchmarks.

The movement of bikes from one location to another during off hours, ie, i bet the direction of many bikes is one directional, that is, 
more people take one to work and then use other transit to get home.

Holiday peak usage, does it drop dramatically?
we can look at major us holidays, so new years jan 1st, memorial day, may 31st, independence day july 4th, labor day september 6th, october 31st, 

last week of the calendar year, versus whenever new york public schools have their spring break? need to find that out()

So holidays, lets grab those for the same year.

And then well just track general monthly trends, which i think is a seperate site ny department of transit or something, it was back one page.
may 6th may 26th 2019, 2020

There are operations reports, we are going to have to look at regular usage to see if there is an uptick in holiday usage, 
so maybe a date a week before and a date week after to provide context, we are using 2019 2020 dates.
